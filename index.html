                            <h1>Personal Information</h1>
                            <p>I am a recent highschool graduate from Albert Park College from which I graduated in 2021, my studies focused on the sciences and music. I have lived in Melbourne, Australia my whole life but have traveled around Europe and some parts of Asia but am only able to speak English.</p>
                            <p>I have interests in music and have a background with music production and the music industry but my passion for music lies with the metal scene with much of my time spent searching for new bands to listen to. I also have a deep appreciation for the sciences, specifically astronomy and I always enjoy keeping up to date with the latest studies and papers surrounding this topic. </p>

                            <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                            <p>My interest in IT began when I was exposed to music production and the technology used. I was intrigued by the way the devices communicated to each other and how each plugin worked and learned how AI is used to produce effects and its uses in things like autotune. This progressed into researching AI in the music industry and its progression with many recent machine learning and AI programs being developed to produce its own music though this is still in its infancy. With my interest in space I was also intrigued by how astronomers research the universe and have interest in the systems used to discover and catalog extra terrestrial bodies using AI and machine learning. Despite being interested in these systems I have little IT experience outside of basic research.</p>
                            <p>My decision to come to RMIT was influenced by my family as some recommended that RMIT was the university that was best suited for me. I started looking into RMIT’s astrophysics course during an open day but found myself drawn towards the computer science and IT departments and decided to further look into what I would learn through the IT related courses. I was impressed by the environment in RMIT and was encouraged to go by those around me to pursue an education here.</p>
                            <p>During my studies I hope to develop the skills and understanding in security systems, AI and machine learning and expand my knowledge with IT systems. I wish to understand how AI and machine learning systems are developed and how they are influencing how we use computers. I want to understand security systems further and develop an understanding of the importance of such systems. </p>

                            <h1>Personality Profile</h1>
                            <p>16 Personalities:</p>
                            <div>
                                   <p style="float: right;">

                                                               width="200"
                                                               height="300"/>
                            <p>The personality type that I received is the Mediator personality type. Described as quiet and open minded this personality type is passionate and idealistic, this personality type typically focuses on helping instead of leading with their focus on pleasing others. Downfalls of this personality type are that typically they are unrealistic, self isolating and unfocused. They struggle to stay on task as they struggle with staying within proper boundaries, the difficulties on staying on task is associated with the unrealistic perceptions that this personality type presents. Mediators think of many different and unrealistic solutions to problems causing them to sit on tasks for longer than needed. Despite mediators wanting to please people, they struggle when meeting new people or groups and may isolate themselves from conversation.
                               Mediators would work well within a team as their affinity for helping would allow them to get along with a team despite their introvertedness, working closely with a team will allow for others to help support with the unrealistic goals and expectations within a project as well as help motivate them to focus within their work. When forming a team, things to consider is that a mediator will likely take time to get to know the team, but will likely get along with most. Mediators are not fit for a leader role as they tend to try to please everyone and are likely to create unrealistic goals for a project.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Learning Styles:</p>
                            <p>I received 0.600 reflector style, 0.143 activist style, 0.067 theorist style and 0.067 pragmatist style. Reflector style learning involves using all information received to formulate a solution. They learn from discussions, analysis, feedback and may take time to process the results of an attempt. Reflector style learners take a distanced approach to their learning as to gather everything they may need to adapt and evaluate their work and produce a proper conclusion. While working with a team, reflectors will likely use group discussion and group feedback to progress their work, this will allow for the reflector to analyze what needs to be done and continue from there. When forming a team working with others who promote discussion and problem solving will allow a reflector to use their learning style most effectively as they will be able to absorb the information and, with time, create a well thought out solution. A team that allows them to have time alone will help with their learning style as it may take more time that usual to effectively learn.</p>
                            <p>The Big 5 Factors:</p>
                            <p>My lowest score from the big five personality traits was extroversion, someone who scores low would be best described as not gaining energy when being surrounded by people. In a work environment this would involve an introvert to be quiet and avoid taking leadership roles within a group as talking with others may be exhausting. 
                               I scored the highest in agreeableness, this trait describes an individual as being likely to show kindness and affection towards others. In a work environment this trait would be able to get along with other members on a project and have a focus on helping others within the group.
                               Emotional stability is if someone is susceptible to frequent mood swings with a lower score meaning someone may experience more mood changes than most. 
                               Conscientiousness is how organized and careful someone is. In a work environment scoring higher on this trait is desirable as it shows how an individual is able to create, stick and execute plans and routines, a lower score may indicate someone is disorganized.
                               The Intellect/Imagination trait demonstrates how open someone is to try something new and explore new experiences.</p>

                            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
                            <p>A planet generation system based on sciences and our current understanding of physics that will give the user realistic information about their desired planet. The program will take a user's input like the type of the planet, size, ect and produce a profile of their created planet. Information on planets of that type, describe how realistic their planet is and what other traits the planet would need for it to feasibly exist. The hope is for the information to be as scientifically accurate as possible. The goal is to have the website help Sci Fi writers to build realistic planets for use in their writings or inspiration as well as being for entertainment purposes.</p>
                            <p>While similar applications have been developed such as fantasy world generation and demonstrations of how different environments may affect a planet, the purpose of the project is to give in depth information to be used for writing and learning purposes. The detail and depth that is intended with the project exceeds what can be found online currently. The goal is for the site to be used as a research tool for science fiction writers or someone developing a space based tabletop RPG to be able to create, categorize and save planets that are grounded within reality with a plethora of factual information. The inspiration for this tool came from the detailed descriptions of planets from the video game series Mass Effect with detailed descriptions of planets that are visible in game.</p>
                            <p>The main feature of the website is a planet creation system where the user will select options from drop down menus and be asked to input values. The user will be asked to select the type of planet and would present options such as gas giant, terrestrial, ice giant or selections of biomes such as desert or ocean. Other possible inputs include size/radius of the planet and orbital distance around its star. When creating a new planet the user will be opted with two modes, ‘Free’ and ‘Realistic’. The ‘Free’ mode will allow for the user to have no limits within their creation of the planet and allow them to create planets that would not be able to exist within real life, an example would be an earth like planet being the size of jupiter. This option is in place to allow users to express as much creative freedom as possible. The downside to this mode is the information produced after the generation of their planet will be very limited and not scientifically accurate. The ‘Realistic’ mode will limit a user's options based on previous inputs, for example, if a user selects the ice giant option they will not be able to make the planet the size of earth or place it in an orbit close to its star. This mode is the intended way to produce a planet and will produce more detailed information once the planet is completed by the user. The goal of the produced fact sheet is to describe the science behind the planet produced by the user, information such as how and why this type of planet is formed, real planets of the same kind and giving different typical characteristics of the users planet. The fact sheet will give more basic information such as orbital period, the length of 1 day on the planet and the gravity on the surface of the planet using the information given by the user during the creation process. When using the ‘Free’ mode the fact sheet will likely not include further data such as an explanation on how their planet is formed as the created planet may not be able to exist in the given criteria. The math used will not be affected by using this mode and the basic information listed before will still be produced.
                               The website will include the option to save created planets, this is done because the goal of the website is to aid in the creative process and help writers use the information to create their works and allow the user to come back to their created planets at any time. Furthermore users will be given the option to name,edit and write their own descriptions on created planets again to help with the creative process. In the future, the site will include extended options such as changing other variables outside the planet itself, options to allow sharing of created planets and a visual representation of your created planet. These are not required for the vision of the site but will be welcome developments.</p>
                            <p>Hardware needed is a computer to develop and test the website. The website will be hosted and created using Github, this includes the creation of the layout, pages and is a part of the user experience. The skills required for producing the website may include: programming the website using html and extended knowledge of the html, these skills can be produced by continued practice using html and learning further through online courses and guides on html. Knowledge using css alongside html will be required as to make the website aesthetically pleasing, this too will be practiced and learnt alongside html. The programming language used to create the information sheet from the user imputed information will be python. Gaining the skills will be done through online courses and practice and possibly through the Intro to Programming course that many are likely to be enrolled into through Bachelor of IT.</p>
                            <p>The website will help users with developing ideas for their writing processes, the site will be useful for science fiction writers, tabletop RPG makers and others looking to extend their knowledge of space. The website will allow for as much creative freedom as possible while still giving accurate information in the form of the fact sheet and allowing users to extend beyond what is given. The project seeks to extend what has been done by others with fantasy planet creation websites by giving extensive information to the user about their planets and to be as realistic and scientifically accurate as possible to the point that the site could be used as a learning tool.</p>
