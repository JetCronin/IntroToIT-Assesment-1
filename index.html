                            <h1>Personal Information</h1>
                            <p>I am a recent highschool graduate from Albert Park College from which I graduated in 2021, my studies focused on the sciences and music. I have lived in Melbourne, Australia my whole life but have traveled around Europe and some parts of Asia but am only able to speak English.</p>
                            <p>I have interests in music and have a background with music production and the music industry but my passion for music lies with the metal scene with much of my time spent searching for new bands to listen to. I also have a deep appreciation for the sciences, specifically astronomy and I always enjoy keeping up to date with the latest studies and papers surrounding this topic. </p>

                            <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                            <p>My interest in IT began when I was exposed to music production and the technology used. I was intrigued by the way the devices communicated to each other and how each plugin worked and learned how AI is used to produce effects and its uses in things like autotune. This progressed into researching AI in the music industry and its progression with many recent machine learning and AI programs being developed to produce its own music though this is still in its infancy. With my interest in space I was also intrigued by how astronomers research the universe and have interest in the systems used to discover and catalog extra terrestrial bodies using AI and machine learning. Despite being interested in these systems I have little IT experience outside of basic research.</p>
                            <p>My decision to come to RMIT was influenced by my family as some recommended that RMIT was the university that was best suited for me. I started looking into RMITâ€™s astrophysics course during an open day but found myself drawn towards the computer science and IT departments and decided to further look into what I would learn through the IT related courses. I was impressed by the environment in RMIT and was encouraged to go by those around me to pursue an education here.</p>
                            <p>During my studies I hope to develop the skills and understanding in security systems, AI and machine learning and expand my knowledge with IT systems. I wish to understand how AI and machine learning systems are developed and how they are influencing how we use computers. I want to understand security systems further and develop an understanding of the importance of such systems. </p>

                            <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
                            <p>IT Support Engineer for Gilmour Space.</p>

                            <h1>Personality Profile</h1>
                            <h2>16 Personalities</h2>
                            <p>The personality type that I received is the Mediator personality type. Described as quiet and open minded this personality type is passionate and idealistic, this personality type typically focuses on helping instead of leading with their focus on pleasing others. Downfalls of this personality type are that typically they are unrealistic, self isolating and unfocused. They struggle to stay on task as they struggle with staying within proper boundaries, the difficulties on staying on task is associated with the unrealistic perceptions that this personality type presents. Mediators think of many different and unrealistic solutions to problems causing them to sit on tasks for longer than needed. Despite mediators wanting to please people, they struggle when meeting new people or groups and may isolate themselves from conversation.
Mediators would work well within a team as their affinity for helping would allow them to get along with a team despite their introvertedness, working closely with a team will allow for others to help support with the unrealistic goals and expectations within a project as well as help motivate them to focus within their work. When forming a team, things to consider is that a mediator will likely take time to get to know the team, but will likely get along with most. Mediators are not fit for a leader role as they tend to try to please everyone and are likely to create unrealistic goals for a project.</p>
                            <h3>Learning Styles</h3>
                            <p>I received 0.600 reflector style, 0.143 activist style, 0.067 theorist style and 0.067 pragmatist style. Reflector style learning involves using all information received to formulate a solution. They learn from discussions, analysis, feedback and may take time to process the results of an attempt. Reflector style learners take a distanced approach to their learning as to gather everything they may need to adapt and evaluate their work and produce a proper conclusion. While working with a team, reflectors will likely use group discussion and group feedback to progress their work, this will allow for the reflector to analyze what needs to be done and continue from there. When forming a team working with others who promote discussion and problem solving will allow a reflector to use their learning style most effectively as they will be able to absorb the information and, with time, create a well thought out solution. A team that allows them to have time alone will help with their learning style as it may take more time that usual to effectively learn.</p>
                            <h4>The Big 5 Factors</h4>
                            <p>My lowest score from the big five personality traits was extroversion, someone who scores low would be best described as not gaining energy when being surrounded by people. In a work environment this would involve an introvert to be quiet and avoid taking leadership roles within a group as talking with others may be exhausting. 
I scored the highest in agreeableness, this trait describes an individual as being likely to show kindness and affection towards others. In a work environment this trait would be able to get along with other members on a project and have a focus on helping others within the group.
Emotional stability is if someone is susceptible to frequent mood swings with a lower score meaning someone may experience more mood changes than most. 
Conscientiousness is how organized and careful someone is. In a work environment scoring higher on this trait is desirable as it shows how an individual is able to create, stick and execute plans and routines, a lower score may indicate someone is disorganized.
The Intellect/Imagination trait demonstrates how open someone is to try something new and explore new experiences.</p>
