                     <h1>Personal Information</h1>
                     <p>I am a recent highschool graduate from Albert Park College from which I graduated in 2021, my studies focused on the sciences and music. I have lived in Melbourne, Australia my whole life but have traveled around Europe and some parts of Asia but am only able to speak English.</p>
                     <p>I have interests in music and have a background with music production and the music industry but my passion for music lies with the metal scene with much of my time spent searching for new bands to listen to. I also have a deep appreciation for the sciences, specifically astronomy and I always enjoy keeping up to date with the latest studies and papers surrounding this topic. </p>

                     <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                     <p>My interest in IT began when I was exposed to music production and the technology used. I was intrigued by the way the devices communicated to each other and how each plugin worked and learned how AI is used to produce effects and its uses in things like autotune. This progressed into researching AI in the music industry and its progression with many recent machine learning and AI programs being developed to produce its own music though this is still in its infancy. With my interest in space I was also intrigued by how astronomers research the universe and have interest in the systems used to discover and catalog extra terrestrial bodies using AI and machine learning. Despite being interested in these systems I have little IT experience outside of basic research.</p>
                     <p>My decision to come to RMIT was influenced by my family as some recommended that RMIT was the university that was best suited for me. I started looking into RMITâ€™s astrophysics course during an open day but found myself drawn towards the computer science and IT departments and decided to further look into what I would learn through the IT related courses. I was impressed by the environment in RMIT and was encouraged to go by those around me to pursue an education here.</p>
                     <p>During my studies I hope to develop the skills and understanding in security systems, AI and machine learning and expand my knowledge with IT systems. I wish to understand how AI and machine learning systems are developed and how they are influencing how we use computers. I want to understand security systems further and develop an understanding of the importance of such systems. </p>
